allHISQ package requirements.  They are installed at FNAL already:

pyYAML and Cheetah

I haven't tried installing from github, but here are the locations:

https://github.com/cheetahtemplate/cheetah
https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml

To build, you need to set your PYTHONPATH to something like

$HOME/python_modules:$HOME/python_modules/lib/python

Then you can run

python2.7 ./setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/python_modules --install-lib=$HOME/python_modules/lib/python

for each of these packages.

--------------------------------------

MILC develop branch

ks_spectrum_hisq

Must be installed in the allHISQ/bin directory.

There have been some changes in the way the "coordinate_origin" and
"time_bc" are handled, so you need an up-to-date pull of this branch.
