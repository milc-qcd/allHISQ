# File system
######################################################################
# The file system has four parts
# These are defined by files/root below

# (1) project: Persistent files common to the entire project (usually the home file system):
#     See files.root.project below

# (2) remote: Large remote files: lattices, propagators, random source files
#     etc.  The ensemble name is appended as a subdirectory.
remoteRoot: '/global/cscratch1/sd/detar/allHISQ/scratch'

# (3) archive: Smaller result files: Output correlators, logs
archiveRoot: '/project/projectdirs/m3414/allHISQ'

# (4) local: Staging location for run-time files.  See files/root/local below.
